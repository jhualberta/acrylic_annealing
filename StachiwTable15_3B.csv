*Does not include the period of time required to raise the oven temperature from ambient room temperature to the set annealing temperature.
The third row value 19.05-22.225 is added by Jie to run the program code properly.
The fourteenth row value 101.6-101.6  is a single range in the original table for 4.0 inch.
