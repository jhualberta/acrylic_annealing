Note1:Assume room temperature 80 °F (27 °C),,,,,,,,,,
Note2: The temperature of material removed from oven after completion of normalizing cycle cannot exceed the ambient room temperature by 15°F (8 °C),,,,,,,,,,
Note3: If the ambient temperature exceeds 80 °F the time to cool down  (category E) may be reduced by multiplying the temperature difference by the approximate cool down rate for the casting thickness and subtracting these hours from category E.,,,,,,,,,,
